A machine learning model can only learn from the data we give it, and making sure that data is relevant to the task is one of the most crucial steps in the machine learning pipeline (this is made clear in the excellent paper [\"A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning\"](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)). \n\nHowever, manual feature engineering is a tedious task and is limited by both human imagination - there are only so many features we can think to create - and by time - creating new features is time-intensive. Ideally, there would be an objective method to create an array of diverse new candidate features that we can then use for a machine learning task. This process is meant to not replace the data scientist, but to make her job easier and allowing her to supplement domain knowledge with an automated workflow.\n\nIn this notebook, we will walk through an implementation of using [Feature Tools](https://www.featuretools.com/), an open-source Python library for automatically creating features with relational data (where the data is in structured tables). Although there are now many efforts working to enable automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning, there has been a lack of automating work on the feature engineering aspect of the pipeline. This library seeks to close that gap and the general methodology has been proven effective in both [machine learning competitions with the data science machine](https://github.com/HDI-Project/Data-Science-Machine) and [business use cases](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/predicting-credit-card-fraud/). \n\n\n## Dataset\n\nTo show the basic idea of feature tools we will use an example dataset consisting of three tables:\n\n* `clients`: information about clients at a credit union\n* `loans`: previous loans taken out by the clients\n* `payments`: payments made/missed on the previous loans\n\nThe general problem of feature engineering is taking disparate data, often distributed across multiple tables, and combining it into a single table that can be used for training a machine learning model. Feature tools has the ability to do this for us, creating many new candidate features with minimal effort. These features are combined into a single table that can then be passed on to our model. \n\nFirst, let's load in the data and look at the problem we are working with."

Feature tools operates on an idea known as [Deep Feature Synthesis](https://docs.featuretools.com/api_reference.html#deep-feature-synthesis). You can read the [original paper here](http://www.jmaxkanter.com/static/papers/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf), and although it's quite readable, it's not necessary to understand the details to do automated feature engineering. The concept of Deep Feature Synthesis is to use basic building blocks known as feature primitives (like the transformations and aggregations done above) that can be stacked on top of each other to form new features. The depth of a \"deep feature\" is equal to the number of stacked primitives. \n\nI threw out some terms there, but don't worry because we'll cover them as we go. Feature Tools builds on simple ideas to create a powerful method, and we will build up our understanding in much the same way. \n\nThe first part of Feature Tools to understand [is an `entity`](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html#adding-entities). This is simply a table, or in `pandas`, a `DataFrame`. We corral multiple entities into a [single object called an `EntitySet`](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html). This is just a large data structure composed of many individual entities and the relationships between them.  \n\n## EntitySet\n\nCreating a new `EntitySet` is pretty simple: "

For the clients dataframe, this is the `client_id` because each id only appears once in the `clients` data. In the `loans` dataframe, `client_id` is not an index because each id might appear more than once. The index for this dataframe is instead `loan_id`. \n\nWhen we create an `entity` in feature tools, we have to identify which column of the dataframe is the index. If the data does not have a unique index we can tell feature tools to make an index for the entity by passing in `make_index = True` and specifying a name for the index. If the data also has a uniquely identifying time index, we can pass that in as the `time_index` parameter. \n\nFeature tools will automatically infer the variable types (numeric, categorical, datetime) of the columns in our data, but we can also pass in specific datatypes to override this behavior. As an example, even though the `repaid` column in the `loans` dataframe is represented as an integer, we can tell feature tools that this is a categorical feature since it can only take on two discrete values. This is done using an integer with the variables as keys and the feature types as values.\n\nIn the code below we create the three entities and add them to the `EntitySet`.  The syntax is relatively straightforward with a few notes: for the `payments` dataframe we need to make an index, for the `loans` dataframe, we specify that `repaid` is a categorical variable, and for the `payments` dataframe, we specify that `missed` is a categorical feature.

The most intuitive way to think of relationships is with the parent to child analogy: a parent-to-child relationship is one-to-many because for each parent, there can be multiple children. The `client` dataframe is therefore the parent of the `loans` dataframe because while there is only one row for each client in the `client` dataframe, each client may have several previous loans covering multiple rows in the `loans` dataframe. Likewise, the `loans` dataframe is the parent of the `payments` dataframe because each loan will have multiple payments. \n\nThese relationships are what allow us to group together datapoints using aggregation primitives and then create new features. As an example, we can group all of the previous loans associated with one client and find the average loan amount. We will discuss the features themselves more in a little bit, but for now let's define the relationships. \n\nTo define relationships, we need to specify the parent variable and the child variable. This is the variable that links two entities together. In our example, the `client` and `loans` dataframes are linked together by the `client_id` column. Again, this is a parent to child relationship because for each `client_id` in the parent `client` dataframe, there may be multiple entries of the same `client_id` in the child `loans` dataframe. \n\nWe codify relationships in the language of feature tools by specifying the parent variable and then the child variable. After creating a relationship, we add it to the `EntitySet`. "

These represent very simple calculations that can be stacked on top of each other to create complex features. Feature primitives fall into two categories:\n\n* __Aggregation__: function that groups together child datapoints for each parent and then calculates a statistic such as mean, min, max, or standard deviation. An example is calculating the maximum loan amount for each client. An aggregation works across multiple tables using relationships between tables.\n* __Transformation__: an operation applied to one or more columns in a single table. An example would be extracting the day from dates, or finding the difference between two columns in one table.\n\nLet's take a look at feature primitives in feature tools.

Examining the names of the features in the dataframe brings us to the final piece of the puzzle: deep features.\n\n## Deep Feature Synthesis\n\nWhile feature primitives are useful by themselves, the main benefit of using feature tools arises when we stack primitives to get deep features. The depth of a feature is simply the number of primitives required to make a feature. So, a feature that relies on a single aggregation would be a deep feature with a depth of 1, a feature that stacks two primitives would have a depth of 2 and so on. The idea itself is lot simpler than the name \"deep feature synthesis\" implies. (I think the authors were trying to ride the way of deep neural network hype when they named the method!) To read more about deep feature synthesis, check out [the documentation](https://docs.featuretools.com/automated_feature_engineering/afe.html) or the [original paper by Max Kanter et al](http://www.jmaxkanter.com/static/papers/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf). \n\nAlready in the dataframe we made by specifying the primitives manually we can see the idea of feature depth. For instance, the MEAN(loans.loan_amount) feature has a depth of 1 because it is made by applying a single aggregation primitive. This feature represents the average size of a client's previous loans."

Automated feature engineering is not limited by these factors (instead it's limited by computation time) and provides a good starting point for feature creation.

Although it's difficult to say which features will be important to a given machine learning task ahead of time, it's likely that not all of the features made by feature tools add value. In fact, having too many features is a significant issue in machine learning because it makes training a model much harder. The [irrelevant features can drown out the important features](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a83b/ddb34618cc68f1014ca12eef7f537825d104.pdf), leaving a model unable to learn how to map the features to the target.\n\nThis problem is known as the [\"curse of dimensionality\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality#Machine_learning) and is addressed through the process of [feature reduction and selection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html), which means [removing low-value features](https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-machine-learning-python/) from the data.

This is a powerful method which allows us to overcome the human limits of time and imagination to create many new features from multiple tables of data. Feature tools is built on the idea of deep feature synthesis, which means stacking multiple simple feature primitives - __aggregations and transformations__ - to create new features. Feature engineering allows us to combine information across many tables into a single dataframe that we can then use for machine learning model training. Finally, the next step after creating all of these features is figuring out which ones are important. \n\nFeature tools is currently the only Python option for this process, but with the recent emphasis on automating aspects of the machine learning pipeline, other competitiors will probably enter the sphere. While the exact tools will change, the idea of automatically creating new features out of existing data will grow in importance. Staying up-to-date on methods such as automated feature engineering is crucial in the rapidly changing field of data science. Now go out there and find a problem on which to apply feature tools! \n\nFor more information, check out the [documentation for feature tools](https://docs.featuretools.com/index.html).
