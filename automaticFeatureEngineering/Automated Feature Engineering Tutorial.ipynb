    "# Introduction: Automated Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at an exciting development in data science: automated feature engineering. A machine learning model can only learn from the data we give it, and making sure that data is relevant to the task is one of the most crucial steps in the machine learning pipeline (this is made clear in the excellent paper [\"A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning\"](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, manual feature engineering is a tedious task and is limited by both human imagination - there are only so many features we can think to create - and by time - creating new features is time-intensive. Ideally, there would be an objective method to create an array of diverse new candidate features that we can then use for a machine learning task. This process is meant to not replace the data scientist, but to make her job easier and allowing her to supplement domain knowledge with an automated workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through an implementation of using [Feature Tools](https://www.featuretools.com/), an open-source Python library for automatically creating features with relational data (where the data is in structured tables). Although there are now many efforts working to enable automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning, there has been a lack of automating work on the feature engineering aspect of the pipeline. This library seeks to close that gap and the general methodology has been proven effective in both [machine learning competitions with the data science machine](https://github.com/HDI-Project/Data-Science-Machine) and [business use cases](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/predicting-credit-card-fraud/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the basic idea of feature tools we will use an example dataset consisting of three tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `clients`: information about clients at a credit union\n",
    "* `loans`: previous loans taken out by the clients\n",
    "* `payments`: payments made/missed on the previous loans\n",
    "\n",
    "The general problem of feature engineering is taking disparate data, often distributed across multiple tables, and combining it into a single table that can be used for training a machine learning model. Feature tools has the ability to do this for us, creating many new candidate features with minimal effort. These features are combined into a single table that can then be passed on to our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load in the data and look at the problem we are working with."

Feature tools operates on an idea known as [Deep Feature Synthesis](https://docs.featuretools.com/api_reference.html#deep-feature-synthesis). You can read the [original paper here](http://www.jmaxkanter.com/static/papers/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf), and although it's quite readable, it's not necessary to understand the details to do automated feature engineering. The concept of Deep Feature Synthesis is to use basic building blocks known as feature primitives (like the transformations and aggregations done above) that can be stacked on top of each other to form new features. The depth of a \"deep feature\" is equal to the number of stacked primitives. \n",

    "After defining the entities (tables) in an `EntitySet`, we now need to tell feature tools [how they are related with a relationship](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html#adding-a-relationship). The most intuitive way to think of relationships is with the parent to child analogy: a parent-to-child relationship is one-to-many because for each parent, there can be multiple children. The `client` dataframe is therefore the parent of the `loans` dataframe because while there is only one row for each client in the `client` dataframe, each client may have several previous loans covering multiple rows in the `loans` dataframe. Likewise, the `loans` dataframe is the parent of the `payments` dataframe because each loan will have multiple payments. \n",
    "\n",
    "These relationships are what allow us to group together datapoints using aggregation primitives and then create new features. As an example, we can group all of the previous loans associated with one client and find the average loan amount. We will discuss the features themselves more in a little bit, but for now let's define the relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "To define relationships, we need to specify the parent variable and the child variable. This is the variable that links two entities together. In our example, the `client` and `loans` dataframes are linked together by the `client_id` column. Again, this is a parent to child relationship because for each `client_id` in the parent `client` dataframe, there may be multiple entries of the same `client_id` in the child `loans` dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "We codify relationships in the language of feature tools by specifying the parent variable and then the child variable. After creating a relationship, we add it to the `EntitySet`. "

The primary benefit of feature tools is that it creates features without any subjective human biases.

Automated feature engineering is not limited by these factors (instead it's limited by computation time) and provides a good starting point for feature creation.

The [irrelevant features can drown out the important features](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a83b/ddb34618cc68f1014ca12eef7f537825d104.pdf), leaving a model unable to learn how to map the features to the target.\n",

    "In this notebook, we saw how to apply automated feature engineering to an example dataset. This is a powerful method which allows us to overcome the human limits of time and imagination to create many new features from multiple tables of data. Feature tools is built on the idea of deep feature synthesis, which means stacking multiple simple feature primitives - __aggregations and transformations__ - to create new features. Feature engineering allows us to combine information across many tables into a single dataframe that we can then use for machine learning model training. Finally, the next step after creating all of these features is figuring out which ones are important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feature tools is currently the only Python option for this process, but with the recent emphasis on automating aspects of the machine learning pipeline, other competitiors will probably enter the sphere. While the exact tools will change, the idea of automatically creating new features out of existing data will grow in importance. Staying up-to-date on methods such as automated feature engineering is crucial in the rapidly changing field of data science. Now go out there and find a problem on which to apply feature tools! \n",
